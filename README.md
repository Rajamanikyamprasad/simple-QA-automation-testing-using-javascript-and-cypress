Replace 'your_username', 'your_password', and 'Your Specific Book Title' with actual values.

Run the test using the Cypress Test Runner:

->Cypress will open a browser and perform the actions defined in the test script. It will log in, search for the book title, mark it as "want to read," remove it from the list, and then log out. You should be able to see the test execution and any assertions made in the Cypress Test Runner.
